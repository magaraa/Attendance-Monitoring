# Attendance-Monitoring
This Android Studio project is an attendance monitoring system designed for use in schools. The app is written in Java and uses Firebase database to store and manage student attendance records. The app incorporates geolocation functionality to ensure students are within school premises while marking attendance. Additionally, the app uses double factor authentication passwords and fingerprint to verify the identity of students.

Features
Geolocation-based attendance marking
Double factor authentication (password and fingerprint)
Lecturer can set time limit for students to mark attendance
Timestamps collected when students log into class
Admin privilege account for managing student records and courses


Installation
To install the app, follow these steps:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in Android Studio.
Connect your Android device to your computer.
Run the app on your device or an emulator.


Usage
Upon launching the app, students will be prompted to log in with their credentials.
Once logged in, the app will use geolocation to verify that the student is within the school premises.
Students will then be prompted to verify their identity using their password and fingerprint.
After verification, students can mark their attendance for each class they are enrolled in.
The lecturer can set a time limit for students to mark attendance, after which the app will no longer allow attendance to be marked for that class.
Timestamps will be collected when students log into each class.
An admin privilege account is available for managing student records and courses. The admin can add or remove students, add classes, and register courses.
